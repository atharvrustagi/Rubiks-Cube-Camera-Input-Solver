# Rubiks-Cube-Camera-Input-Solver
This is a Rubik's Cube solver implementation using Opencv-python and Kociemba module. Scan the cube through your camera, and find the solution through a animation of the solve!

The instructions are on-screen with an easy to understand GUI.

**Note** - You might have to calibrate colors based on your lighting and cube for optimal results. For that, in the "utils.py" file, change RGB values of the dictionary named 'clrs' according to your environment.

Language used - Python

Packages Used - Kociemba, opencv, Numpy, Pygame
